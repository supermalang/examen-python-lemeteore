# Python Assessment
*09-Feb-2022, Master of Artificial Intelligence, Dakar Institute of Technology*

## Assessment Objectives
We would like to write a code that behaves a bit like a Pandas Dataframe

## Getting started
- [x] download the file from the gist link shared
- [x] Create a Github repository
- [x] In that Github repository, add the freshly downloaded file
- [x] Make a first commit and a first push (with the file as is)

## Instructions
- [ ] Complete the program so that the entry point runs without errors
- [ ] All the if block will execute normally if you complete the program
- [ ] You will notice that some methods are already written (no need to touch them)
- [ ] Read and understand well the methods already written
- [ ] Complete only the methods having no body
- [ ] Send concise and regular commits (please don't send me a big commit at the end of the session)

## Hints:
- Browse the Pandas documentation on Series and DatafRames
- Bear in mind there will be a lot of manipulation with dictionaries
